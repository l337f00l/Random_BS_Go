SPINY AND SWOOPER BLOCKS
by TheBourgyman
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This package includes two blocks: one that acts like a mid-air Spiny Egg, and the other like a stationary Swooper. They can be defeated by shells, throw blocks, fireballs, cape, and star power. They interact with Mario almost the same way their sprite counterparts do. Notable exceptions are that Yoshi cannot eat them, and they won't turn into silver coins when a silver p-switch is pressed.

Since these do not take sprite slots, they can be extremely useful to put as obstacles in certain situations and setups where sprite slots are limited.

HISTORY
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This block was built on top of the "Spin Jump Block Pack" (by 5544, Sonikku and wiiqwertyuiop) found on SMWCentral.net, and evolved into something else entirely. Also, code was borrowed from Koopster to allow for Yoshi to run away when touching the hurtbox of these blocks, instead of just killing Mario.

INSTALL
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1. Move "spinyblock.asm" and "swooperblock.asm" into the /GPS folder.
2. Move the contents of the "routines" folder into the /GPS/Routines folder.
3. Move "ExGFX63.bin" into the /ExGraphics folder where your ROM is located.
4. Consolidate the contents of "list.txt" with the "list.txt" file located in the /GPS folder (they use 300 and 301 by default, but you can move them around).
5. Load "demo.mwl" in Lunar Magic. The level allows you to test the blocks in different settings. The animated tiles for the blocks are loaded in the level (in "Level ExAnimated Frames"), just make sure you have done step 3 to ensure you can see them.
6. Import the file "blocks.map16" into the 16x16 Tile Map Editor to get the proper visuals of the blocks, and move them over the location of your blocks, as imported by GPS (300 and 301 by default).
7. Have fun!
