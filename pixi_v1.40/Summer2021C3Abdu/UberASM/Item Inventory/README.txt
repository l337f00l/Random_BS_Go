Something to note this is one of my very first ASMs so somethings could go wrong meaning use at your own risk.

This UberASM works only for per level basis, meaning that it will not work if it is inserted as gamemode 14. 
(technically it works but it won't show the tiles of whats stored since OAM is cleared.)

To insert this ASM copy this inside UberASM Tool's "list.txt", under "level:":
105 itemInv.asm

Here 105 is the level number feel free to change it to whatever you like.
There are a decent amount of configuration options in itemInv.asm, feel free to change them.
