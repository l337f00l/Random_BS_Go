<  Description  >

This dynamic sprite consists of a large P-Switch that can't be carried. It is red and his
sign is a ! instead of a P. When stomped by the player, it will make a squishing animation,
then disappear in a cloud of smoke and stars, slightly making the player jump.

The extra bit determines if it temporaly turns coins into brown blocks and viceversa (like a
blue P-Switch), or if it temporaly turns enemies into silver coins (like a silver P-Switch).

<  How to insert  >

1) Insert "dsx.asm" with asar to your ROM if you haven't inserted it. This will allow you to
insert this sprite and other dynamic sprites. You can download it here:

2) Place "yipswitch.bin" in the same folder as "yi_pswitch.cfg" and "yi_pswitch.asm".

3) Insert the sprite with PIXI to your ROM.
